Requirement of java6(jdk 1.6)

Step1: 
Open Eclipse IDE and create a new project with 3 class files – WordCount.java , WordCountMapper.java and WordCountReducer.java


Step2:
Now Click on Project tab and go to Properties.Under Libraries tab, go to java build path and 
click Add External JARs and select all the jars in the folder
/usr/local/work/hadoop/share/hadoop/common 
and /usr/local/work/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce folders(outside visible folders) 
and /usr/local/work/hadoop/share/hadoop/hdfs(outside visible folders and lib folder).


step3:
Now Click on the Run tab and click Run-Configurations. Click on New Configuration button on 
the left-top side and Apply after filling the following properties.
    
Name – Any name will do – Ex: WordCountConfig
    
Project – Browse and select your project
    
Main Class – Select WordCount.java – this is our main class


Step4:
 Now click on File tab and select Export. under Java, select Runnable Jar.In Launch Config – select the 
config fie you created (WordCountConfig). 
    Select an export destination ( lets say desktop.) 
    
Under Library handling, select Extract Required Libraries into generated JAR and click Finish.
    
Right-Click the jar file, go to Properties and under Permissions tab, Check Allow executing file as a program.
 and give Read and Write access to all the users.


Step5:
Make a hdfs directory ( Note: These directories are not listed when ls is used in the 
terminal and they are also not visible in the File Browser )

hadoop dfs -mkdir -p /usr/local/hadoop/input


Step6:
Copy the sample input text file into this hdfs directory –  
hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal /home/ands/Desktop/raj.txt /usr/local/work/hadoop/input

cd /home/ands/Desktop


Step7:
To run mapreduce:

hadoop jar andy.jar packagename.classname /usr/local/work/hadoop/input /usr/local/work/hadoop/output

   in my case:

hadoop jar andy.jar anand1.WordCount /usr/local/work/hadoop/input /usr/local/work/hadoop/output

or
hadoop jar andy.jar WordCount /usr/local/work/hadoop/input /usr/local/work/hadoop/output

Step8:
To view the wordcount output
hdfs dfs -cat /usr/local/work/hadoop/output/part-r-00000
 
                              or 

hdfs dfs -cat /usr/local/work/hadoop/output/part-00000
