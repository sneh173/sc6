Create a file mapper.py and paste the following.


#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
#Word Count Example
# input comes from standard input STDIN
for line in sys.stdin:
	line = line.strip() #remove leading and trailing whitespaces
	words = line.split() #split the line into words and returns as a list
	for word in words:
	#write the results to standard output STDOUT
		print('%s$%s' % (word,1)) #Emit the word



Create a file reducer.py and paste the following.


#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
from operator import itemgetter
# using a dictionary to map words to their counts
current_word = None
current_count = 0
word = None
# input comes from STDIN
for line in sys.stdin:
	line = line.strip()
	word,count = line.split('$',1)
	#print(count)
	try:
		count = int(count)
	except ValueError:
		continue
	if current_word == word:
		current_count += count
	else:
		if current_word:
			print ('%s$%s' % (current_word, current_count))
		current_count = count
		current_word = word
if current_word == word:
	print ('%s$%s' % (current_word,current_count))



Create a file word.txt and paste the following.

Cat mouse lion deer Tiger lion Elephant lion deer




Now open the terminal and open go the location where these files are saved.
Suppose we create a folder sds on the Desktop and save these files in it.
Hence to the folder sds by following command:


cd /home/sd/Desktop/sds


Then type the following commands on that terminal:



1) Run the mapper by following command:

cat word.txt | python3 mapper.py

2) Run reducer.py


cat word.txt | python3 mapper.py | sort -k1,1 | python3 reducer.py



3) Running the Python Code on Hadoop by following commands.


hadoop fs -mkdir /user


hadoop fs -mkdir /user/edureka


hdfs dfs -put /home/sd/Desktop/sds/word.txt /user/edureka


hadoop jar /usr/local/work/hadoop/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-2.7.3.jar -file /home/sd/Desktop/sds/mapper.py -mapper 'python3 mapper.py' -file   /home/sd/Desktop/sds/reducer.py -reducer 'python3 reducer.py' -input /user/edureka/word.txt -output /user/edureka/Wordcountnew
