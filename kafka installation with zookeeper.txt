First check out for installation of java then::::


Step 2 - ZooKeeper Framework Installation
Step 2.1 - Download ZooKeeper
To install ZooKeeper framework on your machine, visit the following link and download the latest version of ZooKeeper.

http://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html
As of now, latest version of ZooKeeper is 3.4.6 (ZooKeeper-3.4.6.tar.gz).

Step 2.2 - Extract tar file
Extract tar file using the following command

$ cd opt/
$ tar -zxf zookeeper-3.4.6.tar.gz
$ cd zookeeper-3.4.6
$ mkdir data
Step 2.3 - Create Configuration File
Open Configuration File named conf/zoo.cfg using the command vi “conf/zoo.cfg” and all the following parameters to set as starting point.

$ vi conf/zoo.cfg
tickTime=2000
dataDir=/path/to/zookeeper/data
clientPort=2181
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2
Once the configuration file has been saved successfully and return to terminal again, you can start the zookeeper server.

Step 2.4 - Start ZooKeeper Server
$ bin/zkServer.sh start
After executing this command, you will get a response as shown below -

$ JMX enabled by default
$ Using config: /Users/../zookeeper-3.4.6/bin/../conf/zoo.cfg
$ Starting zookeeper ... STARTED
Step 2.5 - Start CLI
$ bin/zkCli.sh
After typing the above command, you will be connected to the zookeeper server and will get the below response.

Connecting to localhost:2181
................
................
................
Welcome to ZooKeeper!
................
................
WATCHER::
WatchedEvent state:SyncConnected type: None path:null
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0]
Step 2.6 - Stop Zookeeper Server
After connecting the server and performing all the operations, you can stop the zookeeper server with the following command -

$ bin/zkServer.sh stop
Now you have successfully installed Java and ZooKeeper on your machine. Let us see the steps to install Apache Kafka.

Step 3 - Apache Kafka Installation
Let us continue with the following steps to install Kafka on your machine.

Step 3.1 - Download Kafka
To install Kafka on your machine, click on the below link -

https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/0.9.0.0/kafka_2.11-0.9.0.0.tgz
Now the latest version i.e., – kafka_2.11_0.9.0.0.tgz will be downloaded onto your machine.

Step 3.2 - Extract the tar file
Extract the tar file using the following command -

$ cd opt/
$ tar -zxf kafka_2.11.0.9.0.0 tar.gz
$ cd kafka_2.11.0.9.0.0
Now you have downloaded the latest version of Kafka on your machine.

Step 3.3 - Start Server
You can start the server by giving the following command -

$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
After the server starts, you would see the below response on your screen -

$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
[2016-01-02 15:37:30,410] INFO KafkaConfig values:
request.timeout.ms = 30000
log.roll.hours = 168
inter.broker.protocol.version = 0.9.0.X
log.preallocate = false
security.inter.broker.protocol = PLAINTEXT
…………………………………………….
…………………………………………….
Step 4 - Stop the Server
After performing all the operations, you can stop the server using the following command -

$ bin/kafka-server-stop.sh config/server.properties
